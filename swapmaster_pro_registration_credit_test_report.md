**Application:** SwapMaster Pro - Advanced Engine Swap Platform  
**URL:** https://3qnsa0bt3lnf.space.minimax.io  
**Test Scope:** Complete user registration pathway and credit system evaluation

## Executive Summary

The testing revealed significant **database connectivity issues** that prevent new user registration from completing successfully. While the application's user interface and feature structure are well-designed, **critical registration functionality is currently broken**, blocking the complete assessment of the credit allocation system.

## Test Results Overview

- Both automated test account creation and manual registration failed with identical database errors

### 3. Credit System Verification ⚠️

**Status:** INCOMPLETE - Cannot verify due to registration failure  
**Findings:**

#### Credit Balance Display Search

- **User Profile Area**: Clicking "Sign In" when logged in redirected to login page (session termination)
- **Pro Features Section**: Shows "Upgrade Now" option but no credit information
- **AI Design Studio**: No usage limits or credit counters visible

#### Credit System Architecture Assessment
- Application appears to use a **subscription-based model** rather than credit-based system
- "Pro Features" section suggests tiered access (Free vs Premium)
- No evidence found of "3 free credits upon registration" system
- AI-powered features (Design Studio, Dynamic Guides) show no usage limitations or credit requirements

### 4. Application Navigation and Structure ✅

**Status:** PASSED  
**Navigation Features Tested:**
- Dashboard - Project overview and statistics
- AI Design Studio - Vehicle mockup generator
- Progress Tracker - Project management interface
- 3D Model Viewer, Parts Inventory, OBD-II Diagnostics (links functional)
- Community features (Chat, Forum, Marketplace)

### 5. Initial User Experience Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clean, professional interface design
- Comprehensive feature set for engine swap enthusiasts
- Logical navigation structure and feature organization
- Responsive UI elements and interactive components

**Critical Issues:**
- **Registration system completely non-functional**
- Database connectivity problems prevent new user onboarding
- Authentication session management issues

## Technical Error Analysis

### Database Connectivity Issues
```
Error #1: Error getting user: AuthSessionMissingError: Auth session missing!
Error #2: Error signing up: Database error saving new user  
Error #3: Supabase API non-200 response: HTTP 500 - unexpected_failure
```

### Impact Assessment
- **High Priority:** New users cannot create accounts
- **Business Impact:** Complete registration flow blockage
- **User Experience:** Frustrating first-time user experience

## Credit System Conclusions

Based on the available testing (limited by registration failures):

1. **No Visible Credit System:** The application does not appear to implement a traditional credit-based system
2. **Subscription Model:** Evidence suggests a "Free vs Pro" subscription approach
3. **No "3 Free Credits" Found:** No indication of automatic credit allocation upon registration
4. **Feature Access:** AI and advanced features may be subscription-gated rather than credit-limited

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Database Connectivity:** Resolve Supabase authentication database errors
2. **Test Registration Flow:** Verify complete registration process once database issues resolved
3. **Implement Error Handling:** Add user-friendly error messages for registration failures

### Further Testing Needed (Post-Fix)
1. Complete new user registration with working database
2. Verify any credit allocation system implementation
3. Test feature access patterns for new vs existing users
4. Validate Pro Features upgrade flow

### User Experience Improvements
1. Add registration success confirmation
2. Implement proper session management
3. Provide clear feature access information

## Conclusion

While SwapMaster Pro demonstrates excellent UI/UX design and comprehensive automotive features, the **critical registration system failure** prevents complete evaluation of the user onboarding experience and any associated credit system. The database connectivity issues must be resolved before the application can successfully serve new users.

**Priority:** HIGH - Address database issues immediately to restore new user registration functionality.
